          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The genesis of PCI Inspect was born out of extensive engagement with e-commerce merchants and payment gateway providers. Through numerous in-depth interviews and meticulous case studies, a recurring and critical pain point emerged: the daunting complexity and persistent challenges associated with achieving and maintaining PCI DSS compliance, particularly concerning client-side security and the evolving threat landscape of web skimming and malware.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            We observed firsthand the struggles businesses faced in understanding and implementing requirements like PCI DSS v4.0.1â€™s 6.4.3 (payment page script management) and 11.6.1 (tamper detection). Many organizations lacked the specialized tools and expertise to effectively monitor their payment pages for unauthorized modifications, manage third-party scripts, and detect sophisticated e-skimming attacks that bypass traditional perimeter defenses. This gap in the market, coupled with the severe financial and reputational consequences of data breaches, fueled our determination to create a solution that was not only effective but also intuitive and accessible.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            PCI Inspect was conceived as a direct response to these real-world challenges, aiming to simplify compliance, enhance security posture, and provide peace of mind to businesses handling sensitive payment data. Our goal was to build a tool that empowers organizations to proactively defend against modern threats, ensuring continuous compliance and robust protection for their digital storefronts.
